Minimum System Requirements:

Because of the way I've programmed it, the game will run at full speed no matter how fast the system.
However, the slower the system, the more frames the game will drop.
The slowest system I have access to was able to play the game with no problems:

Microsoft Windows (any version)
Direct X 7 or above
NVIDIA Riva TNT (16Mb) Graphics card
P3 500 Mhz

But like I say, the requirements don't mean much. It's entirely possible that it runs playably on a slower system. I simply have no way of finding out.

Playing the game:

You are a green square with a minigun. It is your job to keep the four levels clear of red square enemies for as long as possible. Enemies cause damage to the levels. The more enemies, the more damage. The game ends once one of the levels is destroyed.

You start on level 1. To move up or down a level, stand on one of the arrow 'blocks' and press SPACE. The Up arrow moves you up, the down arrow... down. Moving between levels creates a brief shockwave that will destroy any enemies within a small radius.

Every ten seconds (signified by a cheap 'ding') an increasingly greater number of enemies will spawn.

As well as a minigun, the green square has bombs that will clear the level of all enemies, and repair the level a bit. At the start of the game, he has 2. For killing 200 enemies, 1 new bomb is awarded. And for killing 100 enemies, a brief period of invulnerability is awarded.

Controls:

The green square is moved around levels with W,S, A and D.
To move up, or down a level, stand on appropriate arrow (up or down) and press SPACE.
Circular movements of the mouse are used to rotate the gun, Mouse Button 1 is pressed or held to fire bullets, and Mouse Button 2 detonates a bomb.
You can pause, or leave the game at any time with ESC.

So, in summary:

W = Forwards
S = Backwards
A = Left
D = Right

MOUSE = Rotate player

SPACE = Travel up or down a level (depending on where the green square is standing).

MOUSE 1 = Fire gun
MOUSE 2 = Detonate bomb

ESC = Pause / Exit game
